# RLXtreme

RLXtreme is a powerful and efficient Python package for reinforcement learning algorithms, designed to provide state-of-the-art performance and tackle challenging problems. It integrates a wide range of classical and modern reinforcement learning algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and more, to meet the demands of various tasks and applications.

## Features

- High-performance reinforcement learning algorithms
- Efficient training and decision-making processes
- Support for popular algorithms such as DQN, PPO, SAC, etc.
- Advanced optimization techniques for scalability
- Tools for data collection, model evaluation, and result visualization
- User-friendly API for easy model development and experimentation
- Distributed computing and parallel training capabilities

## Installation

To install RLXtreme, you can use pip:

pip install.

## Usage

Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to train a DQN agent using RLXtreme:

```python
import rlextreme

# Create environment
env = rlextreme.make_env("CartPole-v1")

# Create DQN agent
agent = rlextreme.DQN()

# Train the agent
agent.train(env)

# Evaluate the trained agent
rewards = agent.evaluate(env)
print("Average reward:", sum(rewards) / len(rewards))
